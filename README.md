## Checklist
- fill out Readme
- organize my SQL file into three categories and upload
- Visualize my dashboard by myself (considering using Power BI as my main tool)
## Missions
1. draw the diagram to explain data architecture
2. code organization: data warehouse (semantic layer)
3. code organization: data mart (separate into different tables to do data anlaysis)
4. revise the READ.ME
5. dashboard buildup
6. dashboard on README: screenshot and explanation
7. business impact framing: after analysis, what strategy should we try and what would be the impact? (also do scenario analysis to explain how 15% revenue uplift comes from)
8. wrap up and public the github

## Project Overview
Designed an end-to-end analytics workflow to simulate how a DVD rental company can leverage data to optimize pricing, inventory allocation, and revenue performance.

## Business Questions
The company lacked a structured data model to understand:
1. Which films and categories drive the most revenue?
2. Which films have high demand but weak monetization / inefficient inventory?
3. What pricing and inventory actions could improve revenue?

The goal was to develop a data-driven strategy to improve revenue and operational efficiency.

## Resource
- Sakila(MySQL database)
- Tableau Dashboard: visualize the outcome

📊 Demand Distribution Insight

Due to duplicated rental counts across films, multiple films share the same demand rank (using DENSE_RANK()).

This indicates that:

Customer demand is clustered rather than evenly distributed
Many films perform similarly in terms of rental frequency
Ranking-based filtering may include larger groups than expected

## Solution Approach

### 1. Data Warehouse Design (Semantic Layer)
Built a centralized **movie performance data warehouse** by integrating 10+ relational table:

- Source tables: revenue, rental frequency, inventory levels, ROI
- Designed the schema to support scalable analytical queries and decision-making
- Built using SQL transformation (JOIN, CASE, CTEs, subqueries)

Key metrics:
- Revenue per movie
- Rental frequency
- Inventory utilization
- ROI per title

---
## 🔄 ETL Pipeline
- Cleaned and standardized raw transactional data
- Built transformation logic to aggregate business-level metrics
- Ensured consistency between operational data and analytical outputs
---

### 2. Business Analysis & Insights
Performed multi-dimensional analysis to uncover actional insights:

- Movie-level performance
- Genre-level demand patterns
- Inventory allocation efficiency

Key findings:

- High-demand movies were often underpriced  
- Inventory allocation was not aligned with demand  
- ROI varied significantly across titles  

---

### 3. Decision Support & Visualization
Developed Tableau dashboards to translate analysis into business insights:

- Enabled comparison across movies, genres, and store locations
- Supported evaluation of **pricing v.s. demand trade-offs**
- Modeled scenario indicating potential **~15 revenue uplift**
